# RVM for RedHat OpenShift

A customised version of RVM that uses the non-standard install locations and environment variables in use on the RedHat OpenShift service.

## Installing

There's now a detailed guide written on my blog here: bit.ly/HHp9aQ

## Credits & Contributions

RVM - I've merely edited some of the variables in the scripts, so all credit for RVM goes to the contributors and original developers of this awesome piece of software.

OpenShift - Red Hat are quickly changing the game when it comes to PaaS cloud services. When it goes open-source soon, It'll be even better!

I'm no expert when it comes to bash/ruby and still learning, so if you spot any bugs or want to improve it, please feel free!
